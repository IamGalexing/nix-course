This is your first test assignment. Creating tests for existing code is also a very important and necessary activity. And today you will try to do it. To create tests you need to use `react-testing-library`. The [@testing-library](https://www.npmjs.com/org/testing-library) family of packages helps you test UI components in a user-centric way.

in this work you need:

- [ ] Find the first user by name text and check if he exists in the document.
- [ ] Find the first user by test id and check if his name is `Leanne Graham`.
- [ ] Find a list of users by role and check if it contains an item with the text `Leanne Graham`.
- [ ] Ð¡heck that the user `Nikita Vlasenko` is not on the list of users.
- [ ] Find all users with the name `Patricia Lebsack` and check that their number is 2.

The components are already written, you only need to add changes to `.test.js` file
