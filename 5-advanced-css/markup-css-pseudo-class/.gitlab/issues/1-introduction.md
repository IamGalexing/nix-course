# Markup CSS Pseudo-class

Utilize pseudo-classes to replicate the behavior on the design: [Figma file](https://gitlab.nixdev.co/js/edu/asgmt/markup/markup-css-pseudo-class/-/blob/main/public/markup-css-pseudo-class.fig)

To accomplish this task, follow these guidelines:

- Assign the same classes to all shapes.
- Use `nth-child` to describe visual variations between shapes, such as rounding, background, and borders.

This principle applies to rows as well. Each row should have the same class, and `nth-child` selector can be used to identify the sequence number of a row.

`Note`:

- No need to use SVG or other images here.
- No need to apply any logic via JS in this specific task. Just use pure HTML and CSS.

## Requirements

- Code validity: Ensure your code is free of errors.
- Code formatting: Format your code using Prettier or manual formatting, following best practices.
- Markup compliance: Create a markup that aligns with the style guide rules.
- Markup correspondence: Ensure that the markup corresponds to the provided design.
