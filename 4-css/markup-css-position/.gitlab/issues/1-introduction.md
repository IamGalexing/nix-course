`Note`: No need to apply logic via JS in this specific task. It's just a CSS practice task.

## Requirements

- Code validity: Ensure your code is free of errors.
- Code formatting: Format your code using Prettier or manual formatting, following best practices.
- Markup compliance: Create a markup that aligns with the style guide rules.

## Specific Requirements

- The page should be stretched to full viewport height.
- The header and the footer should have fixed sizes, without any stretching (`grow` / `shrink`).
- The header should be sticky while scrolling.
- The main content should be stretched to all available heights.
- Text within each block should be centered both vertically and horizontally.
- The menu should slide to the left when hovering over the button with the menu icon and slide back to the right when the hover state is removed. This animation should not affect the content.
- The sidebar should expand to the right when hovering over the button with the right arrow icon and shrink to the left when the hover state is removed. The content should also adjust in size when the menu is visible.
- All animations should be smooth.
