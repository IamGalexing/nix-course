# Unit Testing Functions

Here are a few more testing assignments. You can test not only components. Today's work also consists of creating tests. This time you need to create tests for the function and also test getting data from the server.

In this work you need:

- [ ] Create a test to check the response from the `formatAddress` function. We must get the format string like: *This user lives in the city of Gwenborough on Kulas Light street in the house Apt. 556. His zipcode is 92998-3874* after passing the data object into the function.
- [ ] Create a test for the `App` component in which we check that we receive data from the server and are displayed on the page

The components are already written, you only need to add changes to `App.test.js` file and  `utils.test.js`
