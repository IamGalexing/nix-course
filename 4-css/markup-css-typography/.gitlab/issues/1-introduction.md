# Markup CSS Typography

Analyze the design and create a typography page with reusable elements according to the design: [Figma file](public/markup-css-typography.fig)

- Download and generate a web font from Font Squirrel resource and apply it exclusively to titles.
- Connect and use Google Fonts as the primary font for your website's text.
- Generate and download the icon web font using services from “Useful links” and integrate this icon font into your website.

`Note`: No need to apply any logic via JS in this specific task. Just use pure HTML and CSS.

## Requirements

- Code validity: Ensure your code is free of errors.
- Code formatting: Format your code using Prettier or manual formatting, following best practices.
- Markup compliance: Create markup that aligns with the style guide rules.
- Markup correspondence: Ensure that the markup corresponds to the provided design.

## Specific Requirements

- Provide correct title styling. Fonts for titles should be downloaded and converted to modern common formats. Modern formats are `woff` and `woff2`
- Provide correct text styling. Fonts for text should be imported from Google Fonts.
- Provide correct icon styling. Icon font should be generated and included on the website.
- Fonts should be stored in a separate `assets/fonts` folder. It’s better to create an appropriate subfolder for each font: `assets/fonts/roboto/…`, `assets/fonts/icomoon/…` 
- All titles, text, and icons should be reusable (have reusable classes), for example `title-sm`, `text-md`, `icon icon-chevron`.
