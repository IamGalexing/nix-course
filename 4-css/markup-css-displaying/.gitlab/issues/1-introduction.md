# Markup CSS Displaying

Analyze the design and create a layout according to the design: [Figma file](https://gitlab.nixdev.co/js/edu/asgmt/markup/markup-css-displaying/-/blob/main/public/markup-css-displaying.fig)

`Note`: you should not use `grid-template-areas` property for this task.

## Requirements

- Code validity: Ensure your code is free of errors.
- Code formatting: Format your code using Prettier or manual formatting, following best practices.
- Markup compliance: Create markup that aligns with the style guide rules.

## Specific Requirements

- The page should be stretched to full viewport height.
- The header and the footer should have fixed sizes, without any stretching (`grow` / `shrink`).
- The header should be sticky while scrolling.
- The footer should stick to the bottom of the viewport when the main content is shorter than the viewport's height. If the page content extends beyond the bottom of the viewport, the footer should be positioned below the content as usual.
- The main content (blocks 1-6) and the sidebar should have equal heights and should stretch to all available heights.  
- Text within each block should be centered both vertically and horizontally.
- Columns 1, 4-6 should have a height equal to their content.
- Columns 2-3 should be stretched to all available space.
