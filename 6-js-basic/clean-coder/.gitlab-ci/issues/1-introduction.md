# Clean Coder

We have some code in the index.js file. But this code does not work as expected! We need your help for fix it! You must fix the errors in the code and format it correctly.
You are already know best practice of code structure and code format! So, good luck!

P.S. Use rthe *`yarn lint-main`* command in terminal. This command will display in the terminal all the errors that are in the **`index.js`** file!

**`FYI:`** `you can not make a commit in case the ESLint found errors!`

Use the *`yarn test`* command to run tests.

## Test Examples

Look at tests for examples:
[Tests](__tests__/index.spec.js)

<!-- Don't forget about labels. Example: -->
<!-- /label level::elementary -->
<!-- /label js::basics -->
