# Routing Electronics Store

We should create a basic SPA application for the Electronics Store.

Tasks:

- Setup router and add routes for the home - "/", contacts - "/contacts", electronics - "/electronics".
- Use React Router v6 ! Create sidebar component with links to the main routes: "/", "/contacts", "/electronics" create a routing using the new syntax `createBrowserRouter`.
  Put the object with the routes in a file: `../Router/RouterConfig.jsx`. It should look something like this:

```js
export const routerConfig = [
  {
    element: <App />,
    ...
```

- Add subroute for the laptops. Main route: "/electronics/laptops"
- Mark routes: "/electronics/laptops/:mark" Model routes: "/electronics/laptops/:mark/:model"
- Add subroute for the telephones.
  - Main route: "/electronics/telephones"
  - Mark routes: "/electronics/telephones/:mark"
  - Model routes: "/electronics/telephones/:mark/:model"
- create a route for non-existent pages with the text "Not Found"
- Add login route and create state for the auth state. Create logout button.
- Make "/electronics" route private, make it visible for the authenticated users only. Redirect to "/" if user isn't authenticated.

Notes:

- Try to use hooks instead of props values.
- For the task #6 try to create a custom PrivateRoute component.
- Get Electronic models and marks from the '/src/constants/electronics.json' file.
