# Render-list

In this task, we will work with one of the most famous part of work in react - render list of data. Every application has some list of data that we need to show on the page. We can do that manually by hand if it isn't a big list of data. But if the list consists of 1000 items or more, we need to think about how can we do that dynamically. We can use standard JS methods like: `map()`.

In this task, your main goal is to render standard array of string `PERSONS` in `App.jsx`

We must have result like this:

**!Important** You mast add attribute `data-testid='list-item'` for every list item
