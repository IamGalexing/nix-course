# Create a Countdown Timer

Your task is to implement a countdown timer using React and the useEffect() hook. The countdown timer should start at a specified duration, such as 60 seconds, and count down to 0. The remaining time should be displayed on the screen and updated every second using the useEffect() hook. You are allowed to use the setTimeout function or any other timer library to handle the countdown logic.

## Instructions

1. Create a new React component called "CountdownTimer".
2. Initialize a state variable, "remainingTime", to hold the remaining time in seconds.
3. Use the useEffect() hook to set up a timer that will update the "remainingTime" every second.
4. Display the "remainingTime" on the screen.
5. When the countdown reaches 0, display a message indicating that the time is up.

**Note:**

- You can use any timer library or the setTimeout function to handle the countdown logic.
- You are free to style the countdown timer as per your preference.
- Make sure your solution is well-structured and follows best practices for React development.

Good luck!
