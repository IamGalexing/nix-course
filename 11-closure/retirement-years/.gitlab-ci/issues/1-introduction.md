# Retirement Years

Implement the 'retirement' function for calculating the number of years remaining until retirement.
As an argument, the function takes the country's retirement age.
As a result, we get a function that calculates by year of birth the number of years remaining until retirement.

## Test Examples

```javascript
const retirementUS = retirement(65);
const result = retirementUS(2000);
expect(result).toBe(45);
```
