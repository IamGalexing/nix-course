## Test functions

Today we are still going to work with tests, but now we are going to test events. Events are sent to notify code that actions of interest have occurred. Events can result from user actions such as mouse use or window resizing, changes in the state of the underlying environment (e.g. low battery or multimedia events from the operating system) and other reasons. There are many events, today we will look at just a few.

In this work you need:

- [ ] Check that the `Tooltip` component is not displayed, but only shows up when hovering over the button.
- [ ] Check that when you click on the `Get Data` button its text changes.
- [ ] Сheck that we are getting a list of users after clicking on the button.
- [ ] Сheck that on key down the text shows

The components are already written, you only need to add changes to `App.test.js` file
